Vehicle History (“Service Proof”)

1. PROBLEM
Used car buyers cannot verify seller maintenance claims. Service records are paper-based, easily forged, or lost. Odometer fraud costs buyers $billions annually. No trusted way to prove vehicle care history.

2. OBJECTIVE
Create public demo where anyone adds their vehicle and logs maintenance on blockchain. Immutable, timestamped service records prove vehicle care. Showcase BSV as solution for automotive trust and transparency.

3. HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS
Core Functionality

* Anyone visits site without login/signup required. Wallet connection required for Car Owner (BSV Desktop Wallet)
* No mechanic verification needed for the log service step (trust-based for demo)
* No owner approval flow (every connected user can create a car and add their own logs without any oversight)
* CREATE TOKEN: 
    * Create a vehicle token, added metadata include VIN, make, model, year, current mileage (optional, if it is second hand) Token can be pushdrop or 1sat tokens
    * Vehicle gets unique blockchain identifier (Token ID)
* UPDATE TOKEN:
    * Log service: type, date, mileage, description, cost
    * Optional: Upload photo of receipt or work completed (UHRP Storage)
    * Logs can be funded by the users wallet or a pool of treasury satoshis
    * All logs timestamped immutably on BSV blockchain
    * Focus on data recording + immutability proof
* VIEW TOKENS
    * Viewing. TBD whether viewing all cars, or only the cars created by that user. Fine with either approach.
    * View complete vehicle history by entering VIN or selecting from the viewable gallery of created cars
    * Can Export service history as PDF report (including txid info)
    * Public explorer: Search any VIN to see history

4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
* Each vehicle record hashed and stored on-chain
* Service logs linked to vehicle via overlay service
* SPV proof generation for each log entry
* Unique URL per vehicle for sharing (e.g., /vehicle/VIN123)
* QR code generation for easy mobile access (optional)
* Responsive design for desktop and mobile (optional, desktop is the focus)



5. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
BSV BLOCKCHAIN COMPONENTS (Optional, ideas, not all are needed)
* @bsv/sdk - Core BSV blockchain SDK for transactions, scripts, hashing, and SPV proofs
* BRC-100 Wallet Interface - Connects to BSV Desktop Wallet for user authentication and transaction signing
* BSV Desktop Wallet (Metanet) - End-user wallet application (users must download/install)
* PushDrop Token Protocol - Creates vehicle tokens with embedded metadata
* Overlay Services Engine - Manages vehicle and service log topics, provides lookup/query capabilities
* SHIP (Service Host Interconnect Protocol) - Broadcasts transactions to overlay network
* SLAP (Service Lookup Availability Protocol) - Queries overlay services for vehicle/log data
* UHRP (Universal Hash Resolution Protocol) - Distributed file storage for receipt images
* UHRP Storage Nodes - Decentralized storage servers (e.g., storage.)
* SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) - Generates and verifies merkle proofs for transactions
* BEEF (Background Evaluation Extended Format) - Transaction format with SPV proofs



6. TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
* You will need a database connected to record data, I recommend Mongodb, but you can choose whatever you are most conformable with. 
* Front end, back end, framework of choice etc
* You need to record all blockchain txid events, and the state of the UTXOs (outputs, not spent, and spent)
